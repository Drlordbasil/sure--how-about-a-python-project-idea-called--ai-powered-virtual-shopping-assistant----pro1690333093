Here are some improvements to the Python program:

1. Move imports to the top and group them together for better readability.
2. Use a single line import for nltk stopwords instead of importing the entire module.
3. Add type hints to function parameters and return types for better understandability.
4. Use a class -level constant for the NLP resource name.
5. Move the NLP resources initialization to a separate method for better organization.
6. Use list comprehension for the preprocess_query function to improve readability.
7. Add docstrings to class methods for better documentation.
8. Use f-strings for print statements to make the code more concise.
9. Remove unused method parameters in fetch_product_prices and track_order methods.
10. Improve the structure and readability of the chat_interface method.
